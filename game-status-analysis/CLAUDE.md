## Project Purpose

**Game Status** ("GAME PRODUCTION WORKFLOW") — a flow-diagram board that mirrors the
game-production workflow on `vvortech.atlassian.net`. Unlike the other dashboards
(chart pipelines), this board renders an **SVG flow graph**: five Jira projects
("spaces") as columns, each status a node showing a **capacity badge `current / limit`**
coloured by usage (🟢 <60% · 🟠 60–90% · 🔴 >90% · ⚪ 0). Each node has an icon; columns
have icon headers; a bottom Legend/Notes/Capacity panel explains the colours. Clicking a
node opens a right panel listing those tickets (Key + Summary + Assignee + link to Jira).

**WIP limit resolution (per node):** Jira board column `max` (from
`result/game_status_limits.json`) → `config.toml` `[limits]` override (`"PROJECT:Status"`)
→ `default_limit` (10). Colour bucket via `capacity_class()` in the generator.

### Spaces → Jira project → diagram statuses

| Column | Project | Statuses shown |
|---|---|---|
| IDEAS | `ID` | Pending Review, Declined, Approved for Production, Prioritized, Game Design & Math, Game Review & Art, Ready for Production with Game Mechanic (+ synthetic Start) |
| GAMES | `GAME` | Planned, Math, Contract Alignment, Development, Integration QC, Optimization, Packaging, Done |
| CERTIFICATION | `CER` | To Do, In Progress, Done |
| LOCALIZATION | `LOC` | To Do, In Progress, Done |
| RELEASE | `RM` | Requested, To Do, Production Ready, Monitoring, Released |

Only the statuses drawn in the diagram are counted; tickets in any other status
(e.g. RM `Backlog`/`UAT`) are excluded. Node **display labels** are decoupled from
the exact Jira **status** string used for count lookup (see `graph_layout.py`).
`ID`/`CER`/`LOC` may legitimately show 0 — those projects are new (LOCALIZATION is
flagged "wip").

## Serve & Share

Mounted as a Blueprint inside `../service-desk-agent/scripts/main.py` at the
**root** (`/`) — no `/game-status` prefix.

Standalone (dev): `python server.py` (binds 0.0.0.0:5000; honours `PORT`).

Refresh buttons work identically standalone and mounted (same root prefix
either way):
- **⚡ Quick Refresh** — incremental (tickets updated since last sync), 60s cooldown
- **🔄 Full Refresh** — re-fetches all tickets, confirm dialog, 180s cooldown

Cooldowns persist in `localStorage` (keys prefixed `gamestatus_`).
Endpoints: `POST /api/refresh`, `POST /api/refresh/full`, `GET /api/status`.

## Setup

Credentials come from the **root `.env`** (`JIRA_DOMAIN`/`JIRA_EMAIL`/`JIRA_API_TOKEN`).
This board's non-secret settings live in `config.toml` (committed):

```toml
spaces = ["ID", "GAME", "CER", "LOC", "RM"]
```

Both scripts call `config_loader.apply(__file__)` (repo-root `config_loader.py`); the
extractor reads `cfg["spaces"]` directly.

## Commands

```bash
# 1. Extract — hits Jira API, writes result/game_status_tickets.csv
python script/game_status_extractor.py

# 2. Visualize — reads CSV + graph_layout, writes result/game_status_visual_report.html
python scratch/generate_game_status_html.py
```

## Architecture

**Two-stage pipeline:**

1. **Extract** — `script/game_status_extractor.py` loops the 5 projects via
   `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql` (cursor pagination), writes `result/game_status_tickets.csv`.
   It also calls `JiraClient.fetch_limits()` (agile API: `board?projectKeyOrId=…` →
   `board/{id}/configuration`) and writes `result/game_status_limits.json` =
   `{project: {status: max}}` for columns that set a `max` (best-effort; never blocks the export).
2. **Visualize** — `scratch/generate_game_status_html.py` reads the CSV + limits JSON,
   buckets tickets by (Space, Status) onto the fixed graph, resolves each node's WIP limit,
   and renders a self-contained SVG flow diagram. All ticket data is embedded at generation
   time → the right panel works client-side with no live API call.

**Flow definition:** `scratch/graph_layout.py` — pure data (the presentation analogue
of the other boards' `report_logic.py`): `SPACES` (incl. `icon`/`subheader`/`subtitle`),
`NODES` (id → space/label/status/x/y/`icon`), `EDGES` (src/dst/label/route), and `ICONS`
(icon key → inline SVG path). **This is the single place to edit if the workflow changes.**
Edge `route` ∈ {`down`, `loop_left`, `wp` (explicit `points`)}; role labels are blank by
design — only `Reskin` / `Certification Needed` / `Localization needed` carry text.

**Server Blueprint:** `server.py` exports `game_status_bp`. Mounted at the root (`/`)
by `../service-desk-agent/scripts/main.py` via `importlib`. Incremental anchor stored
in `result/game_status_last_sync.txt`. Forces this project's `.env` creds into the
subprocess.

## Timeline API

This board also exposes a per-ticket timeline route:

- `GET /api/ticket/<key>/timeline`

It powers the shared modal injected from `../shared/timeline_modal.py`.

### Source of truth for timeline rows

Top-level GAME timeline rows are **field-driven**, not changelog-driven.

- The server resolves Jira field display names to `customfield_xxx` ids at runtime
  through `GET /rest/api/3/field`.
- It then fetches the GAME issue itself and reads these fields per stage:
  - `ETA (Math)`, `Actual Start (Math)`, `Actual End (Math)`
  - `ETA (Contract Alignment)`, `Actual Start (Contract Alignment)`, `Actual End (Contract Alignment)`
  - `ETA (Development)`, `Actual Start (Development)`, `Actual End (Development)`
  - `ETA (Integration QC)`, `Actual Start (Integration QC)`, `Actual End (Integration QC)`
  - `ETA (Optimization)`, `Actual Start (Optimization)`, `Actual End (Optimization)`
- `Packaging` remains a visible stage in the response/UI, but there is no field mapping
  for it yet. Until new Jira fields are added, its `eta` / `actual_start` /
  `actual_end` will be `null`.
- `Planned` and `Done` are intentionally omitted from the timeline response and modal.

### Development sub-stages

Indented Development children (one row per team, e.g. `Math`/`Platform`/`BE`/`BO`/`Devops`)
come from the extractor cache file `result/game_status_substages.json`.

- Per-team work lives in **child issues** — the Jira "Work" panel, i.e. issues whose
  `parent` is the GAME ticket — in separate team projects (`MT`/`PF`/`RNG`/`BO`/`DEVOPS`/…).
  `script/game_status_extractor.py` queries each GAME parent's children via JQL
  `parent = "<key>"`, labels each child by its **project-key prefix** (`MT`→Math,
  `PF`→Platform, …) via the `[substage_teams]` table in `config.toml`; an unlisted
  prefix is skipped (so a GAME parent can have multiple rows for one team, e.g. two
  `RNG` children both → BE).
- Dates come from the child's own **Start date / Due date** fields (no changelog):
  - `entered` = the child's **Start date**. **No Start date → the row is omitted.**
  - `exited` = the child's **Due date**, or `null` ⇒ treated as **in progress**.
  - `eta` = `null` (Start/Due are the plan; there is no separate ETA).
  The "Start date" field id is resolved at runtime by display name via `GET /rest/api/3/field`.
- The timeline route merges those cached rows under the top-level `Development` row.

### Important implementation note

Do not revert the timeline route back to top-level changelog parsing unless the data
contract changes. Changelog is still used elsewhere in this project, but the timeline
modal's main stage dates now come from explicit Jira fields on the GAME issue.

## CSV Schema (pipeline glue)

`result/game_status_tickets.csv`:

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `Ticket` | Jira key (e.g. `GAME-194`) |
| `Space` | Project key (`ID`/`GAME`/`CER`/`LOC`/`RM`) |
| `Status` | Current Jira status (matched against node `status`) |
| `Status Category` | `statusCategory.name` |
| `Summary` | Ticket title |
| `Assignee` | `assignee.displayName`, "Unassigned" if null |
| `Created Date` / `Updated Date` | Timestamps |
| `URL` | `{JIRA_BASE_URL}/browse/{key}` (right-panel link) |

## Jira API Rules

- **Always** `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql`; cursor pagination via `nextPageToken`;
  `timeout=30`; `time.sleep(0.5)` between pages.
- **Incremental fetch:** `SINCE_DATE` env → JQL `AND updated >= "..."`; upsert by `Ticket`.
